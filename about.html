    Hi! I'm Sandy and welcome to my food blog. Each week I usually try a new recipe and
    post it here to share it with the world. If you enjoy any of the recipes that I
    post, please feel free to share it or leave a comment.

    I grew up in Northamptonshire, UK and learned to cook from my mother. Once I had left home and became independant I started cooking full time and even managed to sell some of my baked goods at
    local markets. Now I work full-time within the web design and development industry but my love for cooking remains.

    Although I always try to eat a healthy balanced diet myself, I know that some people have food allergies and intolerences so I try to mix things up a bit so everyone can try some of my recipes. I am certified in Nutrition and health which also includes the management of diabetes. So, trust me, I do understand.
