  <p>
    I'm Sandy and welcome to my food blog. Each week I try out a new recipe and
    post it here to share it with the world. If you enjoy any of the recipes I
    post feel free to leave a comment.

    I grew up in Denver, Colorado and learned to bake from my mother. After
    finishing highschool I started baking full time and selling baked goods at
    local markets. Now I work full-time at a bakery in San Francisco.
