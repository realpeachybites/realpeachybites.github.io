    1. Make the dressing, mix the lemon zest and juice with the caster sugar and greek yogurt in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.

    2. Cook the linguine according to the packet instructions. Add the mangetout for the last 5 minutes of the cooking time.

    3. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a wok or large frying pan, toss in the finely chopped garlic and finely chopped red chilli and cook over a fairly gentle heat for about 30 seconds without letting the garlic brown.

    4. Add the king prawns and cook over a high heat, stirring frequently, for about 3 minutes until they turn pink.

    5. Then add the cherry tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes until they just begin to soften.

    6. Drain the linguine pasta and sugar snap peas well, then toss into the prawn mixture. Tear a handful of basil leaves and add to the pasta, season with salt and pepper.

    7. Serve with mixed salad leaves drizzled with the lemon dressing, and crusty white bread.
